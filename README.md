# C++ Keylogger Project
First C++ Project implementing self-taught skills and techniques.  
Only to be used for personal and educational purposes.  
Key features:  
-Implemented Keyboard Hook to intercept Keyboard strokes before they reach the application.  
-Completely silent execution with no detection from Anti-Virus (Avast)  
-VBS Script used to Dim Shell and prevent CMD from flashing (Alerting the user)  
-Decoy Web Browser shortcut pointing to VBS Script which runs both the Keylogger and browser.  
-Incredibly lightweight with 0-1% CPU usage  
-Output to .bin file discourages average user from touching the file  
-Implemented special keys for readibility (Shift, Backspace etc.)  
-Uppercase and Lowercase functionality  
-Simple killKeylogger .exe to kill process without cumbersome Task Manager  
-Short and simple readable code  
-Implemented Windows vkCodes  
-Functionality accomplished using Windows API  
-Simple name to confuse user in Task Manager  

TO EDIT:  
-Change Decoy Icon to desired web browser  
-Change Decoy Start in path to the location of the VBS Script  
-Edit Line 4 in the VBS Script to point to desired browser .exe  
-Replace Desktop or Menu Web Browser shortcut to Decoy and change name
